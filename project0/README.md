# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

My project is a rather simplistic website that lists a few of my favorite travel locations and activities throughout the years and I did my best to include everything specified in the assignment rubric. Here is a breakdown of my project's files:

ALL html files:
	All of my html files share a few similarities so I thought I would list them here. These include the link to Bootstrap 4, the styles.css stylesheet, and a div holding the buttons for navigation.

mainPage.html:
	This page should launch first and simply has a title with descriptive text to infrom the user of what is within the site. It consists of a heading (h1), and a div which contains a welcome paragraph text with an image.

places.html:
	This page contains a list with bootstrap columns for organizational style. 

images.html:
	This page contains many of my own images as a sort of gallery with an h5 heading. All of the images are stored as figures to allow for easier "captioning". 

expo.html:
	This page contains a few descriptive headings and a table to organize some of my favorite experiences by location.

styles.css:
	This is my SCSS stylesheet to be converted to styles.css containing sass variables, inheritance, and nesting objects.

styles.css:
	My stylesheet for all of the .html files consists of basic CSS properties, and CSS selectors. I also have my @media query stored here.

images:
	I have included all of the images I used for the "gallery" and main page and will be found in the project directory.
