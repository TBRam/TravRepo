		<h1>Welcome To Travis' Travels</h1>

		<div id="Greet">
		<p>Greetings to all who have accessed this "website". I decided to create this simple website in dedication of one of my favorite things, travel. </p>
		
		<p>In this webpage I will briefly touch on places around the US and the rest of the world that I have gotten lucky enough to visit, and some places that I would like to go as a sort of personal inspiration. </p>

		<p>Thanks for coming along for the ride. Without further ado, let's get started! </p>
